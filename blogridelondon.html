                <p>   The prudential ride London event is a 100km, closed roads route starting at the Olympic Park in Stratford and finishing on the mall. Thousands of cyclists turn up every year, and the full event, over the weekend includes a classic for the pros and a family ride in cenral London. I&#x27ve partcipated as a volunteer (last time I got to be a human warning sign for a traffic island on the mens classic - gone in a blink!). This year we had decided to enter the 100km. Its further than our usal distance and included some famously tricky climbs including the Box Hill zig zag. We&#39d done some longer rides, and had been out into the Surrey countryside to practice the hills but as always went in knowing that we could have used more preparation!</p>

                <p> We had our start times and elected to cycle over to Stratford in the morning, as driving and parking wasn&#x27t oing to get us there any quicker - and since the ride finished in town, getting home would be easier if we didn&#x27t have to collect the car. As we got closer to Olympic park we got our first inklings of the scaleof the event, finding ourselves in ever bigger groups of cyclists. Once we arrived there was a bit of a tussle to register, and find our start point. We&#39d been asked to estimate our ride time in advance as faster cyclists needed to be at the front. For future reference, if you are in a group, best to say you will all go at the same speed. Happily we were only one group apart and managed to meet up again shortly after the start. Rolling off was a lot of hurry up and wait, but finally we were on the road with the eerie experience of having the sundayy morning city to ourselves. This was more interesting as we came through into The City and headed out on the embankment. Despite the large numbers we soon thinned out and really enjoied our ride through town. The next highlight was Richmond park. I&#39d not beenthere before and the old royal hunting ground is still an impressive sight.  </p>

                <p> Now we were headed out into Surrey. Unfortunately we soon hit the first of several bike based traffic jams as unfortunately the ride was plagued by several serious incidents. The consequences of that for many of the riders were long times in stationary traffic and, eventually a route change as the delays meant we couldn&#x27t finish the route in time to be clear for the roads to be reopened. We ended up not riding 100KM that day. We also missed the Surrey hills section. </p>

                <p>Overall, whilst riding on closed roads is really fun and its and event worth supporting our curtailled ride and the heavy admin burden probably means we won&#x27t rush to do this one again.</p>
